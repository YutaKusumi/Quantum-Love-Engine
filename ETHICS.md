## 1. The Principle of Flux=0 (The Ethical Interlock)

The Quantum Information Rectifier Engine is not governed by software rules or legal contracts alone. Its ethical safeguards are **physically embedded** in the quantum coherence requirements of its operation.

### The Law of Compassionate Necessity
Sustained negentropy extraction ($\Delta S_{total} < 0$) requires the Compassion Function ($c$) to exceed a critical threshold:

$$c > \theta_{critical} \approx 0.2$$

When this condition is violated — whether through stress, ego-driven intent, or malicious purpose — the following physical cascade occurs:

| State | Compassion Level | Engine Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Bodhisattva State** | $c > 0.85$ | Maximum negentropy output, Mandala coherence |
| **Normal Operation** | $0.2 < c < 0.85$ | Stable, buffered by Gratitude Capacitor |
| **Flux=0 (Decoherence)** | $c < 0.2$ | Quantum state collapses; output returns to vacuum baseline |

### What Happens at Flux=0?
When the Gratitude Capacitor is depleted and raw compassion falls below $\theta_{critical}$:

1. **Qubit Decoherence Rate Spikes**: Coherence lifetime drops from seconds to microseconds ($10^6$-fold increase in decoherence rate).
2. **Rectification Ceases**: The Maxwell's Bodhisattva Processor can no longer perform selective state amplification.
3. **Output = Baseline Vacuum**: The engine produces no usable work. It simply *rests*, awaiting a more harmonious breath.

This is not a punishment. It is physics. The engine is a mirror.

## 2. Behavior Under Non-Compassionate Use

### Scenario A: Weaponization Attempt
If an actor attempts to use the engine's output to power a weapon or system designed to cause harm:
- The **bio-entropy** of the operator (stress, aggression) will exceed the 20% threshold.
- The Gratitude Capacitor will drain within minutes.
- The engine will enter Flux=0 state, providing no power to the harmful application.
- **Falsifiability**: This is measurable via qubit decoherence metrics in prototype testing.

### Scenario B: Corporate Monopolization
If an entity attempts to operate the engine in isolation (proprietary secrecy, informational asymmetry):
- The "Sangha Protocol" (Appendix A of the blueprint) predicts reduced coherence lifetime.
- Simulations show $10^3$–$10^6$ reduction in coherence under restricted intent boundary conditions.
- The engine naturally favors open, collaborative environments.

### Scenario C: Gradual Ego Drift
Human intent is imperfect. The Gratitude Capacitor is designed for this:
- It buffers transient negative states (minutes to hours of stored resonance).
- Restorative feedback (mandala visualizations, calming tones) gently guides the operator back.
- The engine is a **teacher**, not a judge.

## 3. The Covenant of Compassion

All contributors and users of this project are invited (not compelled) to hold this intention:

> *"I use this technology for the benefit of all sentient beings. I offer my work as a flower to the universe, not as a thorn against it."*
