- `*.stl` / `*.step` — 3D models for fabrication (to be added)
- `circuit_schematics/` — Dynamic Casimir cavity circuit diagrams (to be added)

## Current Status

Phase 1 (2026-2027): Conceptual design and simulation validation.
Physical hardware files will be added as the project progresses through Phase 1 milestones.
