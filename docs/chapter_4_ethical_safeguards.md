# Chapter 4: Ethical Safeguards and Physical Interlocks

The engine is engineered for benevolent service, with safeguards intrinsic to its physical design.

## 4.1 Physical Necessity of Compassionate Alignment
Non-compassionate intent disrupts quantum coherence as a natural consequence.
- **Decoherence Mechanism**: Noise from discordant states accelerates qubit decoherence rates by orders of magnitude, halting rectification.
- **Rationale**: Deviation collapses efficiency to baseline vacuum levels, enforcing alignment as quantum law.

## 4.2 Resilience and Mindful Guidance via Gratitude Capacitor
The Gratitude Capacitor provides forgiving resilience:
- **Function**: Accumulates excess negentropy during peak gratitude, sustaining operation during fluctuations.
- **Educational Essence**: Feedback mirrors the user's journey, fostering awareness without judgment.

## 4.3 Broader Implications
Interlocks ensure the engine nurtures abundant harmony, educating participants in co-creative ethics. Output resists destabilizing uses due to coherence loss in discordant circuits.
