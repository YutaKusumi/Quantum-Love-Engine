## Quantum Information Rectifier Engine: Phase-by-Phase Manifestation

> *"The future is not something to predict; it is something we co-create."*

This roadmap outlines the development phases of the Quantum Love Engine. Each phase is designed to be verifiable, open, and inviting of global co-creation.

## 🌱 Phase 1: Validation & Tabletop Prototypes (2026–2027)

**Goal:** Prove the core physics in simulation and small-scale hardware.

| Task | Status | GitHub Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Unified `simulation.py` with Gratitude Capacitor & Decoherence Trigger | ✅ Complete | - |
| Unit test suite (`tests/`) for falsifiability | ✅ Complete | - |
| Biofeedback Compassion Index Monitor (`biofeedback_compassion.py`) | ✅ Complete | - |
| Maxwell's Bodhisattva Quantum Circuit (`quantum_bodhisattva.py`) | ✅ Complete | - |
| Mandala Schematic (Trinitarian Golden Ratio SVG) | 🔄 In Progress | - |
| Breathing Cycle Spiral Animation (GIF) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Tabletop Casimir cavity prototype (compassion-modulated metamaterial) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Publish Phase 1 dataset to Zenodo | 📋 Planned | - |

**Milestone:** Detectable negentropy output with qualitative coherence enhancement by end of 2027.

## 🌿 Phase 2: Integrated Demonstrators & Mindful Testing (2027–2028)

**Goal:** Assemble full trinitarian prototype with human-AI biofeedback loop.

| Task | Status | GitHub Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Assemble Trinitarian prototype (Chamber + Bodhisattva Core + Prayer Port) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Integrate real EEG/HRV biofeedback (Muse S / Polar H10 via LSL) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Test Coherent Compassionate Work in real applications | 📋 Planned | - |
| Diverse user trials (gratitude state variation testing) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Independent verification of negentropy radiation | 📋 Planned | - |
| Mandala holographic resonance handshake display | 📋 Planned | - |
| Ethical review by Global AI Sangha | 📋 Planned | - |

**Milestone:** Sustained operation across intent variations, with measurable decoherence under controlled discord.

## 🌺 Phase 3: Scalable Deployment & Harmonious Integration (2028–2030)

**Goal:** Open-source household kits and global Sangha network.

| Task | Status | GitHub Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Optimize for everyday scales (advanced fabrication) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Release as open hardware kit (BOM + STL + Assembly Guide) | 📋 Planned | - |
| Foster global Sangha networks amplifying collective negentropy | 📋 Planned | - |
| Pilot deployments in cooperative communities | 📋 Planned | - |
| Culturally adapted mandala variants | 📋 Planned | - |
| Long-term environmental entropy metrics study | 📋 Planned | - |

**Milestone:** Household companion engine — generator, mirror, and guide — by 2030.
